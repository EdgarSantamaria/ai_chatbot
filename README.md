# AI Youtube Chatbot App

This project is a React-based web application that allows users to enter a YouTube video URL, ask a question about it, and receive a response from an AI assistant. The application is built using React, Material-UI, and interacts with a backend API that uses OpenAI, Pinecone, and Langchain to process the user's question.

## Test The Application
The library used to obtain YouTube transcripts only works locally, so users are given 3 options to test the application on the deployed version.

## Features
* YouTube Video Selection: Users can input a YouTube URL.
* Question Input: Users can input a question related to the selected YouTube video.
* AI Response: The application sends the user's question and video URL to an API, which processes the query and returns a response generated by an AI assistant.
* Reset Functionality: Users can reset the video selection and ask a new question about a different video.
